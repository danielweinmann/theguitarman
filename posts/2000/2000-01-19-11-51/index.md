Fairy Tale  
  
The story passes in a neighborhood  
But at the same time it's inside the woods  
And when the neighbour looks just like a bear  
A bunch o robbers enters in the local fair  
  
The policemen riding their special horses  
Had just arrived when they started to rob  
And the men who called themselves "robbers in the hood"  
Fled as they could to hide in sherwood  
  
I must confess the name is not original  
But nothin it would have of magical  
'Cause a tale that is fair is not a fairy tale  
And pinocchio wouldn't be the same  
If it hadn't been eated by the whale  
  
But the story goes on within the forest...to be continued
